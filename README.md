## 1. Introduction

**TicketFlix** is a modern, real-time movie ticket booking system that replicates the core experience of platforms like BookMyShow and Fandango. It enables users to discover currently playing and upcoming movies (via the TMDB API), select showtimes, choose their preferred seats from a multi-tier layout (Premium / Gold / Silver), and complete payment through Stripe Checkout. Upon successful payment, users receive a beautifully designed PDF ticket download and an email confirmation.

The platform includes a fully functional **Admin Dashboard** where administrators can add new shows by searching TMDB, manage existing shows, view booking analytics, and monitor revenue — all protected behind role-based access control using Clerk's private metadata.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional movie ticket booking involves standing in long queues, limited showtime visibility, and no real-time seat availability. Even many online solutions lack:

- **Real-time seat locking** — Multiple users may attempt to book the same seats simultaneously, leading to double-booking conflicts.
- **Automatic reservation expiry** — If a user abandons payment, seats remain unavailable indefinitely.
- **Tiered pricing** — Different seat sections (front, middle, back) often need different price points, which many systems don't support.
- **Unified movie data** — Manually entering movie details is error-prone and time-consuming for administrators.
- **Secure, role-based admin access** — Admin panels are often protected by weak, home-grown authentication.

TicketFlix addresses all of these issues with a robust, production-grade architecture.

### Data Flow

1. **User opens app** → ClerkProvider initializes auth state → AppContext fetches shows and favorites.
2. **User browses movies** → Client fetches TMDB data via server proxy endpoints.
3. **User selects a show** → Client fetches occupied seats for that show from the database.
4. **User selects seats** → Prices are calculated client-side based on section (Premium/Gold/Silver).
5. **User clicks "Book Now"** → Server creates a booking, marks seats as occupied, creates a Stripe Checkout session, and triggers an Inngest reservation timer.
6. **User pays on Stripe** → Stripe webhook marks booking as paid and sends a confirmation email.
7. **If user doesn't pay within 10 min** → Inngest function auto-releases the reserved seats and deletes the booking.

## 8. Authentication Flow

TicketFlix uses **Clerk** for authentication — a complete, hosted auth solution that handles sign-up, sign-in, session management, and user profiles out of the box.

### Flow Overview

```

│    3. Check user.privateMetadata.role === 'admin'                   │
│    4. If not admin → return 403                                     │
│    5. If admin → next()                                             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Concepts

1. **ClerkProvider** wraps the entire React app, providing auth context to all components.
2. **`useUser()`** hook gives access to the current user object on the client.
3. **`useAuth().getToken()`** generates a short-lived JWT for API requests.
4. **`clerkMiddleware()`** on the server validates the JWT and populates `req.auth()`.
5. **`protectAdmin`** middleware fetches the full Clerk user and checks `privateMetadata.role === 'admin'`.
6. **Clerk Webhooks** (via Inngest) sync user data to MongoDB on create, update, and delete events.

### Admin Role Assignment

Admin access is controlled via Clerk's **Private Metadata** (set in the Clerk Dashboard):

```json
{
  "role": "admin",
  "favorites": ["798645", "1291608", "840464"]
}
```

Only users with `role: "admin"` in their private metadata can access admin routes. The "Dashboard" link appears in the Clerk UserButton dropdown only for admin users.

## 9. Seat Selection Logic

### Seat Layout Configuration

The theater has **10 rows** (A–J) with **10 seats per row**, organized into three pricing tiers:

| Tier        | Rows       | Position | Color  | Description                   |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Premium** | A, B       | Front    | Yellow | Best view, highest price      |
| **Gold**    | C, D, E, F | Middle   | Purple | Most popular, mid-range price |
| **Silver**  | G, H, I, J | Back     | Gray   | Value seats, lowest price     |

### Seat ID Format

Each seat is identified as `{Row}{Number}`, e.g., `A1`, `C5`, `J10`.

### Selection Flow

```
1. User selects a showtime
   └─▶ Client fetches GET /api/booking/seats/:showId
       └─▶ Server releases expired reservations first
           └─▶ Returns array of occupied seat IDs

2. User clicks available seats
   └─▶ Client calculates total based on section prices
       └─▶ Premium seats × premium price
       └─▶ Gold seats × gold price
       └─▶ Silver seats × silver price

3. User clicks "Book Now"
   └─▶ POST /api/booking/create { showId, selectedSeats }
       └─▶ Server double-checks availability
       └─▶ Creates booking with 10-min reservation
       └─▶ Marks seats in show.occupiedSeats
       └─▶ Creates Stripe Checkout session
       └─▶ Triggers Inngest timer event
       └─▶ Returns Stripe Checkout URL
```

### Anti–Double-Booking Strategy

1. **Immediate seat locking** — When a booking is created, seats are instantly marked in `show.occupiedSeats` before the Stripe session is created.
2. **Expired reservation cleanup** — Before returning occupied seats or creating bookings, the server runs `releaseExpiredSeats()` to free seats from timed-out unpaid bookings.
3. **Inngest background timer** — A dedicated Inngest function waits 10 minutes, then checks if the booking is still unpaid. If so, it removes seats from `occupiedSeats` and deletes the booking.
4. **Atomic checks** — `checkSeatsAvailability()` verifies none of the selected seats are already occupied before proceeding.

      │         Webhook: checkout.session.completed
      │         ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
      └────────▶│  POST /api/stripe (Stripe Webhook)   │
                │  • Verify signature with svix          │
                │  • Mark booking.isPaid = true          │
                │  • Send confirmation email              │
                └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Payment Verification (Dual Strategy)

1. **Stripe Webhook** (`/api/stripe`) — Server-side, triggered automatically by Stripe on `checkout.session.completed`. Marks booking as paid and sends email.
2. **Client-side Verification** (`/api/booking/verify-payment`) — When the user is redirected back, the client sends the `session_id` to verify payment status. This acts as a fallback in case the webhook is delayed.

### Reservation Expiry

- Seats are reserved for **10 minutes** (`RESERVATION_MINUTES = 10`).
- Stripe's minimum session expiry is 30 minutes, but the server enforces its own 10-minute timer via Inngest.
- If payment is not completed within 10 minutes, the Inngest `releaseUnpaidSeats` function:
  1. Waits 10 minutes (`step.sleep("wait-for-payment", "10m")`)
  2. Checks if booking is still unpaid
  3. Removes seats from `show.occupiedSeats`
  4. Deletes the expired booking

## 13. Installation Steps

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+ installed
- **MongoDB** database (local or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas))
- **Stripe** account ([stripe.com](https://stripe.com))
- **Clerk** account ([clerk.com](https://clerk.com))
- **TMDB** API key ([themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))
- **Inngest** account ([inngest.com](https://www.inngest.com)) — or use `npx inngest-cli@latest dev` for local development
- **Brevo** account ([brevo.com](https://www.brevo.com)) for SMTP — or any SMTP provider

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ticketflix.git
cd ticketflix
```

### Step 2: Install Server Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### Step 3: Install Client Dependencies

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both `server/` and `client/` directories. See [Section 14](#14-environment-variables) for details.

### Step 5: Set Up Clerk

1. Create a Clerk application at [clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Copy the **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**
3. Configure a **Webhook Endpoint** pointing to `<your-server-url>/api/inngest` with events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
4. Set **Private Metadata** for admin users:
   ```json
   { "role": "admin" }
   ```

### Step 6: Set Up Stripe

1. Create a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Copy the **Secret Key** from the Dashboard
3. Set up a **Webhook Endpoint** pointing to `<your-server-url>/api/stripe` with event: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy the **Webhook Signing Secret**

### Step 7: Set Up Inngest (Local Development)

```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

This starts the Inngest Dev Server at `http://localhost:8288`. Register your app at `http://localhost:3000/api/inngest`.

### Step 8: Start the Server

```bash
cd server
npm run server
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 9: Start the Client

## 15. Deployment Guide

Both the frontend and backend are configured for **Vercel** deployment as separate projects.

### Deploy the Backend (Server)

1. Push `server/` to a GitHub repository (or as part of the monorepo).

2. Import the project in [Vercel](https://vercel.com):
   - **Root Directory:** `server`
   - **Framework Preset:** Other
   - **Build Command:** (leave empty)
   - **Output Directory:** (leave empty)

3. The `vercel.json` in `server/` routes all requests to `server.js`:

   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [{ "src": "server.js", "use": "@vercel/node" }],
     "routes": [{ "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "server.js" }]
   }
   ```

4. Add all **server environment variables** in Vercel's project settings.

5. Update Clerk and Stripe webhook URLs to point to the deployed server URL.

### Deploy the Frontend (Client)

1. Push `client/` to a GitHub repository.

2. Import the project in Vercel:
   - **Root Directory:** `client`
   - **Framework Preset:** Vite
   - **Build Command:** `vite build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist`

3. The `vercel.json` in `client/` handles SPA routing:

   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
   }
   ```

4. Add all **client environment variables** in Vercel's project settings.
   - Update `VITE_BASE_URL` to the deployed backend URL.

### Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Update `VITE_BASE_URL` in client env to the production server URL
- [ ] Update Clerk webhook endpoint to production server URL
- [ ] Update Stripe webhook endpoint to production server URL
- [ ] Register Inngest app with production server URL
- [ ] Verify CORS settings allow the production frontend domain
- [ ] Test end-to-end booking flow (seat selection → payment → email)
